<h1 id="introduction" class="unnumbered">Introduction</h1>
<p>The word Bhairava is made up of “bha&quot; + “ra&quot; + “va&quot;. “Bha&quot; means the sustenance of the universe and “ra&quot; means dissolution of the universe and “va&quot; means manifestation of the universe. These are the prime qualities of God (the Brahman) — creation, sustenance and dissolution. In the Bhairava form of Śiva, His ultimate reality is coupled with the eternal awareness of Śakti. The Svarṇākarṣaṇa Bhairava form is different from the forms of Bhairava that we have discussed in “Forms of Bhairava&quot; and “Pervasive Bhairava&quot;. This Svarṇākarṣaṇa Bhairava form is considered as the Supreme combination of Śiva and Śakti from where the Universe originates, sustains and dissolves. The <span><em>upāsanā</em></span> of Bhairava is considered indispensable for all <span><em>upāsakas</em></span> of Bhagavatī. Lord Bhairava is worshiped in various forms: as the consort of Mahāvidyā Goddesses (Akṣōbhya Bhairava, Krodhabhairava, etc.); as the consort of the Mātṛkā group of deities (Asitāṅga Bhairava, Ruru Bhairava, etc.); as the son of Bhagavatī, Vaṭuka, who is indispensable to <span><em>saparyā</em></span>, as is the Kumārī; various forms of Bhairavas who form the retinue of Bhagavatī invoked for protection such as Baḍabānala Bhairava, Ākāśabhairava, Unmatta Bhairava, etc; special forms invoked for specific purposes by <span><em>śākta</em></span>-s: Svarṇākarṣaṇa Bhairava for protection and prosperity, Sammōhana Bhairava (for enchantment), Svacchanda Bhairava (as Mahāguru in <span><em>śrīkula krama</em></span> system), etc.</p>
<p>Śrī Svarṇākarṣaṇa Bhairava is an <span><em>uttarāṃga</em></span> mantra to Mahāṣoḍaśī, Mahāprāsāda and also Vanadurgā. His association with Śrī Vidyā and Māhātmya are described in “Sundarī Tantra”.</p>
<p><em>tripurāyāḥ pure ramye mūle kalpataroḥ śubhe<br />
sthitaḥ simhāsane tatra bhāti kaḥ puruṣaḥ paraḥ<br />
dāsībhūtā mahālakṣmīḥ purato yasya rājate<br />
tasya me devadevasya mahāmantram̐ vada prabho</em></p>
<p>Parvati questions thus: “Lord! Who is the resplendent Puruśa seated on a throne under the wish-fulfilling <span><em>kalpavṛkśa</em></span> in the beautiful city of Śrī Tripurasundarī (Śrīpuram)? Mahālakṣmī, the goddess of wealth, has stationed herself in his service [1]. Please describe the great mantra of this deity.”</p>
<p><em>mahātripurasundaryāḥ pure bhogasamnvite<br />
mūle kalpatarormahāsane maṇivirājite<br />
svarṇākarṣaṇanāmā’sau bhāti śrībhairavaḥ svayam<br />
bhaktānāṃ tripurāmbāyāḥ dhanarāśipradāyakaḥ<br />
alakṣmīnāśanaḥ sākṣāt brahmaviṣṇuśivātmakaḥ</em></p>
<p>Śrī Dakṣinamurti replies thus: “In the city of Śrī Mahātripurasundarī filled with riches, seated on a gem-studded golden throne is the great Svarṇākarṣaṇa Bhairava. He grants enormous wealth to the devotees of Śrī Tripurāmbika. He destroys misfortune and his form constitutes of Brahmā-Viṣṇu-Rudra, the trinity.”</p>
<p><em>brahmā nārāyaṇaḥ śambhurindrādyā lokapālakāḥ<br />
nityamenaṃ pūjayanti sampattyarthaṃ maheśvari<br />
sarvasampatprado nṝṇāṃ mahādāridryanāśakṛt</em></p>
<p>“The trinity, Indra and other deities worship him to obtain riches. He grants prosperity to men and destroys poverty”.</p>
<p><em>purā pitāmaho devamenaṃ sampūjya bhairavam<br />
samprāpāṣṭaguṇaiśwaryam jagatkartṛtvamuttamam<br />
purā nārāyaṇaḥ sākṣāt swarṇākarṣaṇabhairavam<br />
śrīśatvamapa sampūjya dhanādhyakṣaṃ mahābalam<br />
aṇimādiguṇaiśvaryaṃ purā prāptaṃ mayā śive</em></p>
<p>“Even the trinity worshiped him to obtain the powers of creation, destruction and sustenance”.</p>
<p>Mahādeva then goes on to describe the mantra [2] of The Lord and various <span><em>prayoga</em></span>-s to obtain unimagined riches [3]. As “Sundarī Tantra” [4] is a Śrīkula—<span><em>kādi krama ṭantra</em></span>, Svarṇākarṣaṇa Bhairava, described as an <span><em>aṇga</em></span> here, would pertain to <span><em>kādi ṣoḍaśī</em></span>. “Sundarī Tantra” teaches <span><em>aṇga rāhitya</em></span> for <span><em>pancadaśī</em></span>. Svarṇākarṣaṇa Bhairava is described as one of the primary <span><em>aṇga</em></span>-s of Śrīvidya in “Dattātreya Samhitā”. He is a part ofthe “Raśmimala”, among the “Chintāmaṇi Traya” [5]. By <span><em>sampradaya</em></span>, Svarṇākarṣaṇa Bhairava is one of the sixteen <span><em>aṇga</em></span>-s of <span><em>sādi vidyā saptadaśākṣarī</em></span>. The <span><em>upāsanā</em></span> of Bhairava involves, along with mantra, <span><em>japa</em></span> and <span><em>āvaraṇa pūjā</em></span>, recitation of <span><em>mālā, sahasranāma</em></span> [6], <span><em>aṣṭottara, kavacha, stavarāja</em></span> and <span><em>hṛdaya</em></span>. The details of these however have to be received directly from one’s Guru.</p>
<p><em>Notes</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<p>[1] Mahālakṣmī is described as serving the Lord in various <span><em>dhyāna śloka</em></span>-s of this Bhairava. The “Svarṇākarṣaṇa Aṣṭottara” includes several names such as: Mahālakṣmyarcitapadaḥ, Ramāpūjitapādābjaḥ, Vaikuṇṭhaśrīsamāśritaḥ, etc. Mahālakṣmī and Madhumati are the two <span><em>aṇgavidya</em></span>-s of Śrī Svarṇākarṣaṇa Bhairava. “Svarṇākarṣaṇa Bhairava Tantra” (which most possibly is a part of the bigger <span><em>śaiva āgama</em></span>, “Mahapanchākṣarī Tantra”, also housing other smaller tantras such as “Chidambara Tantra”) describes a story where Mahālakṣmī lost her powers due to a curse by Śrī Durvasa Bhattaraka and worshipped Bhairava at Avimukta kṣetra to regain her powers.</p>
<p>[2] The particular form of mantra described in “Sundarī Tantra” seems to be the version used popularly by <span><em>śrīvidyā upasaka</em></span>-s. For some reason, this mantra is published in hundreds of corrupted forms in various manuals and these corruptions can hardly be dismissed as <span><em>pāṭhāntara</em></span>-s. There are two other forms of mantra, one from an unknown source quoted in “Āmnāya Kalpalatā” (copied as is in later works such as “Amnaya Mantra Sangraha”, “Saparya Paddhati”, “Lalitarchana Chandrika”, etc.) and the other from “Skanda Yāmala” in the “Vanadurgā Mahāvidyā Prakaraṇa”. Though the mantra described in the context of <span><em>mahāvidyā</em></span> is different, most <span><em>upāsaka</em></span>-s seem to use the first and the popular version during recitation of <span><em>panchaṣatī/saptaṣatī</em></span>. The only <span><em>sampradāya</em></span> which seems to use “Skandayāmala” as <span><em>pramāṇa</em></span> is that of Kalyanananda Bharati of Andhra Desha. They use a mixture of “Vanadurgopaniṣad” and “Kalpa Kaustubha” (of Rudrayamala) for the <span><em>mūla pāṭha</em></span> of <span><em>mahāvidyā panchaśati</em></span> but utilize the <span><em>aṇga-vidyā krama</em></span> of “Skanda Yamala”. Of course, everything said by Kalyanananda Bharati has to be consumed with a pinch of salt and sometimes pepper too!</p>
<p>[3] The worship of Svarṇākarṣaṇa Bhairava is chiefly for prosperity and sudden financial gains but that is not the sole benefit of this <span><em>upāsanā</em></span>. He is also an Apaduddharaṇa mūrti who destroys hindrances and protects the <span><em>upāsaka</em></span>. Svarṇākarṣaṇa Bhairava, famed to be stationed in Chidambaram in the service of Śrī Chitasabhapati and Śrī Śivakamasundari, is described as <span><em>bhairavo viṣṇurūpakaḥ</em></span> in “Chidambara Tantra”. He is thus identified as non-different from Śrīmannarayana. He is further described as a combination of Samkarṣaṇa and Bhairava <span><em>svarupa</em></span>-s of Narayana and Mahādeva respectively. Due to <span><em>sattva prādhānya</em></span>, his mantra is considered ok to be given to women (substituting the <span><em>praṇava</em></span> with <span><em>ramā bīja</em></span>) initiated into Śrīvidya as women are prohibited from obtaining the mantra of Vaṭuka Bhairava (“Hamsamāheshvara”, “Rudrayāmala”, etc.). However, <span><em>upāsana</em></span> of Svarṇākarṣaṇa Bhairava mantra has to be undertaken only under the direct guidance of Sadguru as the mantra activates <span><em>kuhū nāḍi</em></span> and malfunctioning of this <span><em>nādī</em></span> can cause irreparable damage to a person. <span><em>Kuhū</em></span> functions towards ejaculation and its abuse can push the consciousness into netherworlds.</p>
<p>[4] “Sundarī Tantra” is described in the list of tantras speltout in “Vārāhī Tantra”. Another list, in yet another tantra, speaks of a “Tripurasundarī Tantra”. Some hold these two tantras to be the same. But Śrī Gopinath Kaviraj-ji writes somewhere that the two are independent tantras. “Sundarī Tantra” is available almost completely.</p>
<p>[5] The “Chintāmaṇi Traya” includes: Svarṇākarṣaṇa Bhairava, Ardhanārīśvara Chintāmaṇi and Chintāmaṇi Ganapati.</p>
<p>[6] I have not personally seen the “Sahasranāma of Śrī Svarṇākarṣaṇa Bhairava” anywhere but have heard about the existence of one such <span><em>sahasranāma</em></span> in the possession of Ganapati Sacchidananda Swami of Mysore. Also, in the “Uttara Pīṭhikā” of the “Svarṇākarṣaṇa Hṛdaya”, there is a clear indication of the existence of such a <span><em>sahasranāma</em></span>. Śrī Svarṇākarṣaṇa Bhairava, Bhāgavan Śrī Śuddha Dakśinamurti, Śrī Dattatreya, Bhāgavan Śrī Nṛsiṃha and Bhāgavan Śrī Ucchiśta Maha Ganapati are said to be the five <span><em>trimūrtyātmaka mūrti</em></span>-s worshipped in the <span><em>ūrdhāmnaya</em></span> of Kādi Krama Tantra. Even outside the realms of the Śrīvidya Krama Tantra, they are described to be <span><em>trimūrtyātmaka</em></span>.</p>

The sage (<span><em>ṛṣiḥ</em></span>) is the divine seer Brahmā, the meter (<span><em>chandas</em></span>) for the mantra is <span><em>paṅkti</em></span> and the deity is the intelligence giver Śrī Harihara Brahmātmaka Svarṇākarṣaṇa Bhairava; the seed (<span><em>bījaṃ</em></span>) is <span><em>hrīm̐</em></span>, the power or <span><em>śakti</em></span> is <span><em>saḥ</em></span>.

<p>Salutations to Lord Svarṇākarṣaṇa Bhairava, who is yellowish gold in complexion with four arms, three-eyed and adorned in golden garments. His eyes appear as golden rubies and He is emanating brilliance resembling a lightning like bolt, that engulfs the entire Creation. He readily grants all our cherished wishes and desires. He is holding a <span><em>trident</em></span> (to dispel all the triads), bearing a whisk and a lance (to penetrate the <span><em>cakra</em></span>-s) and is also adorned with all types of precious and rare gems, gold and beautiful strings of pearls. He is comfortably seated and intoxicated with bliss and is ready to fulfill all our wishes. He is constantly reflecting upon and immersed in the welfare of the Creation and is endowed with unlimited <span><em>siddhi</em></span>-s. He is in the midst of a forest full of the fragrant and mystical trees called <span><em>pārijāta</em></span> and in a hall of precious gems and crytals of unmatched beauty and glitter. He is to be meditated as seated upon a royal lion faced throne and ready to bestow any wish of His sincere devotees.</p>

<p><em>atha śrī svarṇākarṣaṇa bhairava ṣaṭpañcāśatyakṣara mantraḥ</em></p>
<p>Following is the 56-lettered Śrī Svarṇākarṣaṇa Bhairava mantra, that should be recited at least 108 times (1 <span><em>mālā</em></span>):</p>
<p><em><strong>om̐ aim̐ hrīm̐ śrīm̐ āpaduddhāraṇāya hrām̐ hrīm̐ hrūm̐ ajāmala-baddhāya lokeśvarāya svarṇākarṣaṇa bhairavāya mama dāridrya vidveṣaṇāya mahābhairavāya namaḥ śrīm̐ hrīm̐ aim̐</strong></em></p>
<p>The <span><em>bīja</em></span> mantra <span><em>om̐</em></span> represents Śabda Brahman and is also called the <span><em>praṇava</em></span> mantra or the primordial sound, the manifested super- consciousness in the form of sound and all syllables. All other sounds and waves are said to have emanated from this mantra. The <span><em>vāgbhāva bīja</em></span> mantra <span><em>aim̐</em></span>, represents all knowledge, spiritual and material. The <span><em>māyā bīja</em></span> mantra <span><em>hrīm̐</em></span> represents manifestation of everything as the power of Creation, sustenance as the power of Preservation and transformation as the power of Destruction. It is also related to concentration, focus, energy, drive, self-esteem, high power and is the main <span><em>śakti</em></span> mantra. The Lakṣmī <span><em>bīja</em></span> mantra <span><em>śrīm̐</em></span>, represents abundance, wealth, well-being and prosperity, as well as fructification of all efforts.</p>
<p>The word ‘<span><em>āpaduddhāraṇāya</em></span>’ signifies — the one who rescues us from all dangers and miserable conditions.</p>
<p>The <span><em>bīja</em></span> mantra <span><em>hrām̐</em></span> pulls us away from karmic bonds and infuses spirituality into our mind and intellect. The <span><em>hrīm̐</em></span> <span><em>bīja</em></span> mantra represents the power of Destruction and applied to the individual self, it is the destruction of our inner karmic bonds represented by <span><em>antaḥkaraṇa</em></span> (mind, ego and the intellect) that bind the consciousness to the physical, astral and causal bodies. The form shifting <span><em>kinnara bīja</em></span> mantra <span><em>hrūm̐</em></span> brings complete transformation in our spiritual outlook and leads us towards self-realization. In this context Lord Bhairava is aided by the Divine Mother Bhairavi, who wields the power of Destruction and transformation and is the Destroyer of the Creation.</p>
<p>The word ‘<span><em>ajāmala-baddhāya</em></span>’ is a combination of ‘<span><em>aja</em></span>’ meaning — leader, ‘<span><em>amala</em></span>’ meaning — blemish-less and ‘<span><em>baddhāya</em></span>’ meaning — bound. He is a blemish-less leader and Lord and bound to the devotion of His devotees. The word ‘<span><em>lokeśvarāya</em></span>’ signifies — the Lord who rules over all the worlds (and the Creation Itself). The word ‘<span><em>svarṇākarṣaṇa</em></span>’ represents attraction of all types of abundance including gold, precious gems, money, etc. The word ‘<span><em>bhairavāya</em></span>’ represents the Lord Bhairava, who is a terrific form of Lord Śiva and is seen as a Protector. He is worshipped as a generous boon giver by His devotees.</p>
<p>The word ‘<span><em>mama</em></span>’ means myself/us. The word ‘<span><em>dāridrya</em></span>’ means all types of poverty, miseries and unfortunate conditions. The word ‘<span><em>vidveṣaṇāya</em></span>’ signifies — the One who hates <span><em>dāridrya</em></span>. The word ‘<span><em>mahābhairavāya</em></span>’ represent Lord Śiva Himself as the chief Mahābhairava. The <span><em>namaḥ</em></span> <span><em>bīja</em></span> mantra is for offering salutations to the deity and indicating our complete surrender and request to the deity to take charge of our destiny.</p>
<p>The <span><em>bīja</em></span> mantras <span><em>śrīm̐</em></span>, <span><em>hrīm̐</em></span> and <span><em>aim̐</em></span> are for encasing the mantra for added protection and easier fruition. This process of reversing the mantras at the end occurring earlier in the mantra, is called <span><em>sampuṭīkaraṇa</em></span>.</p>
<p>“Salutations to the Supreme Lord Svarṇākarṣaṇa Bhairava, the One who never fails to come to the rescue of His devotees, relieve us of all karmas, infuse uninhibited spirituality, material abundance and contentment in us and remove all types of misery from our lives once and for all.”</p>

<p>The <span><em>bīja</em></span> mantra <span><em>om̐</em></span> represents Śabda Brahman and is also called the <span><em>praṇava</em></span> mantra or the primordial sound, the manifested super-consciousness in the form of sound and all syllables. All other sounds and waves are said to have emanated from this mantra. The <span><em>vāgbhāva</em></span> <span><em>bīja</em></span> mantra <span><em>aim̐</em></span> represents all knowledge, spiritual and material. The <span><em>māyā</em></span> <span><em>bīja</em></span> mantra <span><em>hrīm̐</em></span> represents manifestation of everything as the power of Creation, sustenance as the power of Preservation and transformation as the power of Destruction. It is also related to concentration, focus, energy, drive, self-esteem, high power and is the main <span><em>śakti</em></span> mantra. The Lakṣmī <span><em>bīja</em></span> mantra <span><em>śrīm̐</em></span> represents abundance, wealth, well-being and prosperity, as well as fructification of all efforts.</p>
<p>The second <span><em>vāgbhāva</em></span> <span><em>bīja</em></span> mantra <span><em>aim̐</em></span> re-iterates the need to obtain all the knowledge we need to succeed in all our tasks and become accomplished. The second Lakṣmī <span><em>bīja</em></span> mantra <span><em>śrīm̐</em></span> indicates the desire for fruition of all our efforts.</p>
<p>The word ‘<span><em>āpaduddhāraṇāya</em></span>’ signifies the one who rescues us from all dangers and miserable conditions.</p>
<p>The <span><em>bīja</em></span> mantra <span><em>hrām̐</em></span> pulls us away from karmic bonds and infuses spirituality into our mind and intellect. The <span><em>hrīm̐</em></span> <span><em>bīja</em></span> mantra represents the power of Destruction and applied to the individual self, it is the destruction of our inner karmic bonds represented by <span><em>antaḥkaraṇa</em></span> (mind, ego and the intellect) that bind the consciousness to the physical, astral and causal bodies.</p>
<p>The form shifting <span><em>kinnara bīja</em></span> mantra <span><em>hrūm̐</em></span>, brings complete transformation in our spiritual outlook and leads us towards self-realization. In this context Lord Bhairava is aided by the Divine Mother Bhairavi, who wields the power of Destruction and transformation and is the Destroyer of the Creation.</p>
<p>The word ‘<span><em>ajāmala-baddhāya</em></span>’ is a combination of ‘<span><em>aja</em></span>’ meaning — leader, ‘<span><em>amala</em></span>’ meaning — blemish-less and ‘<span><em>baddhāya</em></span>’ meaning — bound. He is a blemish-less leader and Lord and bound to the devotion of His devotees. The word ‘<span><em>lokeśvarāya</em></span>’ signifies — the Lord who rules over all the worlds.</p>
<p>The word ‘<span><em>svarṇākarṣaṇa</em></span>’ represents attraction of all types of abundance including gold, precious gems, money etc. The word ‘<span><em>bhairavāya</em></span>’ represents the Lord Bhairava, who is a terrific form of Lord Śiva and is seen as a Protector. He is worshipped as a generous boon giver by His devotees.</p>
<p>The word ‘<span><em>mama</em></span>’ means myself/us. The word ‘<span><em>dāridrya</em></span>’ means all types of poverty, miseries and unfortunate conditions. The word ‘<span><em>vidveṣaṇāya</em></span>’ signifies — the One who hates <span><em>dāridrya</em></span>. The word ‘<span><em>mahābhairavāya</em></span>’ represent Lord Śiva Himself as the chief Mahābhairava.</p>
<p>The <span><em>namaḥ bīja</em></span> mantra is for offering salutations to the deity and indicating our complete surrender and request to the deity to take charge of our destiny. The <span><em>bīja</em></span> mantras <span><em>śrīm̐</em></span>, <span><em>hrīm̐</em></span> and <span><em>aim̐</em></span> are for encasing the mantra for added protection and easier fruition. This process of reversing the mantras at the end occurring earlier in the mantra, is called <span><em>sampuṭīkaraṇa</em></span>.</p>
<p>“Salutations to the Supreme Lord Svarṇākarṣaṇa Bhairava, the One who never fails to come to the rescue of His devotees, relieve us of all karmas, infuse uninhibited spirituality, material abundance and contentment in us and remove all types of misery from our lives once and for all”.</p>
